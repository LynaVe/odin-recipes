    <h2>How to Make Lasagna Step-by-Step</h2>
    <p>Directions on how can you make a<br> homemade lasagna:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over<br>
             medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato<br>
             sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons<br>
             parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds,<br>
             and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna<br>
             noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse<br>
             with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,<br>
             remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt./li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-<br>
            inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.<br>
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the<br>
            mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over<br>
            mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat<br>
            layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br>
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray<br>
            or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake<br>
             for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before<br>
             serving.</li>
